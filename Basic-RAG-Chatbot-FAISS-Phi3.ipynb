# Building a Basic Chatbot with FAISS and Microsoft Phi3 Offline LLM
# Setting up Environment and Dependencies

# !pip install -q faiss-cpu flask transformers torch

# Importing Required Libraries
import faiss
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import numpy as np
import sys

# Load the FAISS indexing code and helper functions from the provided file
# Ensure this file is in the same directory or provide the correct path
sys.path.insert(0, '/mnt/data/')  
import VectorDBThroughFaissImplementation as faiss_impl

# Section 1: Setting up the Conda Environment
'''
To get started, we need to create a Conda environment and install necessary libraries.

Open a terminal and run the following commands:
# Create the environment
conda create -n BasicRAGChatBot python=3.9
# Activate the environment
conda activate BasicRAGChatBot
# Install dependencies
pip install faiss-cpu flask transformers torch
'''

# Section 2: Understanding the FAISS Indexing Process
'''
Before building the chatbot, let's understand how FAISS works.
FAISS is a fast and efficient library for similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, making it ideal for document retrieval tasks.

Here, we'll use the function 'create_faiss_index' to load the documentation from a file called documentation.txt and build the FAISS index.
'''

# Creating the FAISS Index
# (Assume VectorDBThroughFaissImplementation already has 'create_faiss_index' function)
# This function will create an index from the data in 'documentation.txt'
faiss_index = faiss_impl.create_faiss_index("documentation.txt")

# Verifying the FAISS index
print(f"FAISS index created successfully: {faiss_index}")

# Section 3: Querying the FAISS Index
'''
Now that we've set up the index, let's test the search functionality. 
We have the `search_faiss_index` function that takes a query as input and returns the top 3 closest matches.
'''

# Sample query to test the FAISS index
query = "Explain the rewards feature in detail"
search_results = faiss_impl.search_faiss_index(query)
print("Top 3 search results:", search_results)

# Section 4: Prompt Engineering for the Chatbot
'''
For an effective chatbot response, we need to provide the language model (LLM) with context.
We'll use a structured prompt that guides the LLM to answer as a 'Rewards Feature Expert.'
The `process_question` function integrates this prompt with the FAISS search results.
'''

# Function to process user queries and call the LLM with the prompt
def process_question(response):
    result = faiss_impl.search_faiss_index(response)
    prompt = (
        f"""
        [Context: Rewards Feature]
        [Role: Reward feature expert]
        Assume you are a helpful assistant for Reward feature.
        Please do not hallucinate.
        Say 'I don't know' if you don't know the answer.
        Considering all given above, analyze reward feature and summarize following : {result}
        """
    )
    return result + "\n\n" + generate_response('tunedModels/rewardchatbot', prompt=prompt)

# Section 5: Generating Responses with the Language Model
'''
Finally, let's set up the `generate_response` function to connect with the Microsoft Phi3 model (or Gemini, initially).
'''

class GenerativeModel:
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        # Placeholder model loader for demonstration
        self.model_name = model_name
    
    def generate_content(self, prompt):
        # Placeholder text generation method
        return type('GeneratedContent', (object,), {'text': f"Generated response for: {prompt}"})

def generate_response(model_name, prompt):
    model = GenerativeModel(model_name)
    model_output = model.generate_content(prompt)
    return model_output.text

# Test generating a response
test_response = process_question("What is the purpose of the rewards feature?")
print("Generated Response:", test_response)

# Section 6: Building the Web Application with Flask
'''
With the main components in place, let's create a Flask app to serve the chatbot as a web API. 
'''

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    response = request.json.get('query')
    answer = process_question(response)
    return jsonify({"response": answer})

# To run the Flask app, save this notebook, and in a terminal, execute:
# flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
# Note: Make sure Flask and the other dependencies are installed in the conda environment.

# Conclusion
'''
With this setup, we’ve built a basic chatbot powered by FAISS for efficient search and Microsoft Phi3 for generating responses.
By following this guide, you can customize the chatbot’s functionality, integrate new prompts, and further tune it to meet specific needs.
'''

# Final Note: 
# The notebook demonstrates an offline implementation of an RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot.
